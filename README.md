MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010

Last updated on Apr 20, 2016

Instructor(s):
Prof. Patrick Henry Winston

MIT Course Number:
6.034

As Taught In:
Fall 2010

Level:
Undergraduate

This course introduces students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence. 

Upon completion of 6.034, students should be able to develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems; understand the role of knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning in intelligent-system engineering; and appreciate the role of problem solving, vision, and language in understanding human intelligence from a computational perspective.

Description: 

We consider a block-stacking program, which can answer questions about its own behavior, and then identify an animal given a list of its characteristics. 

Finally, we discuss how to extract knowledge from an expert, using the example of bagging groceries.

Description: 

Can multiple weak classifiers be used to make a strong one? 

We examine the boosting algorithm, which adjusts the weight of each classifier, and work through the math. 

We end with how boosting doesn't seem to overfit, and mention some applications.
